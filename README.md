# Data Scientist Codes Collection

This repository collects Python scripts implementing algorithms and techniques widely used by leading data scientists. It also includes a portfolio of SQL templates for common analytics tasks and a minimal continuousâ€‘integration setup.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the static code analysis and formatting checks:
   ```bash
   ruff .
   sqlfluff lint sql/
   ```

3. Execute the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest -q
   ```
